She has a slim figure and a strong overbearing field, and shows her exquisite dancing skills on the stage. She not only has a great music style, but also has a beautiful and lovely image. In the video, she has rose-blond hair, which is very white, and makes her look like her name, with thorns that make people want to be close to her. She seemed to emanate from her bones a kind of aristocratic socialite. Golden-brown big roll, with a socialite style of the small skirt, is Princess Rosebud herself.</p>
